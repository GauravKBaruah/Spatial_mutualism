# Project repository for spatial mutualistic networks 


## Facing the challenge of combining trait evolution, trait variance, mutualism strength, HOIs and selection modes to decipher coexistence, richness and stability properties in spatial mutualistic networks.


# Summary NOV 20 2020
## Key: Obtain Jacobian HOI
 
## Feasibility Trait variance-HOI map :: Richness, community abundance, stability
## Sign matrix: Would it be possible to obtain a qualitative expectation for the Richness trait variance-HOI map?
 
 
# Summary DEC 23 2020
## Key: Jacobian approximation for HOI 

## Mihir draft briefly discussed :: Trait coevolution, clustering and coexistence in competitive networks
## Preliminary results trait variance -- mutualism strength scenarios (high and low) for Community abundance, Richness, Trait matching
## Selection mode vs HOI plot :: Does NFDS (i.e., negative frequency dependent selection) increase total HOI effect on Community abundance and Richness? What is the data telling us about it?
